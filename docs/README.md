# Requirements

As the administrator of the Scooter company I would like to monitor my 
application so that I know if it is running and if it has enough disk space.

# Backlog refinement
Meeting to discuss the requirements from the backlog.

# Estimate the requirements - Sprint planning
## Story points
As a developer you estimate the amount of work required to deliver the requirement.
 * 1 story point - very simple change (e.g. change the name of a field)
 * 2 story points - simple change
 * 3 story points - it is clear what you need to do. You expect to finish without problems.
 * 5 story points - more complex, you don't know all the details that need to be changed
 * more than 5 - the precision of the estimation decreases

# Ways of working
 * checkout new branch 
 * make changes
 * commit
 * push
 * create Pull Request
 * wait for comments & approval
 * merge Pull Request
